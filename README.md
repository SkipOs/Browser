# How to Browser
Many have tried to start a project like this, and I'm one of them.
What you are thinking probabbly is that I'm either really crazy to try to start to do it, or too naive. I'm probabbly both, but If I don't try, I'll never know. 

But the thing is, I think I can do it. Eventually, it is. The main objective is to learn after all, so why not?

I hope to learn, get involved in this process and try to understand how to build a browser, logging in my issues and project my process into doing it.

Hopefully, while writing how I did It, I will learn more and get more ideas in the process, even helping someone with the same desire to start a project like this, while also grasping on why stuff is done in the way it's done.

That's it.
